# STA 518 - Final Project Proposal
## Topological Signal Processing For Spectral Partitioning
## Author: Joseph Fahnestock

### Topic

This project will focus on creating an R implementation of the work found in [Dr. Michael Robinson's text "Topological Signal Processing"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36104-3_3#Sec7) where Dr. Robinson shows how to reduce a graph Laplacian to a topological filter which can be more simply defined. I will replicate this using R libraries and expand on it to study diffusion of posts on social media with the graph Laplacian representing the likelihood of a random walk reaching a certain terminal node.

### Tasks

This project will entail three main tasks:

* The ETL of social media data and profile information from socialblade.com and Instagram.
* The creation of an R package/script for graph diffusion using topological methods.
* The creation of an R notebook report showcasing the new package/script in use on the collected social media data.

### Understanding Gained

This project will be an opportunity to learn how to implement more mathematically complex algorithms in R and increase my comfort with using tidyverse tools.
